# This repository contains my group's final report submission for our Capstone Project we did with Biomolecular systems.
## The aim of the report is to act as a guided tour of our project. The report includes some critical examination of how our project measured against the plans we laid out in phases one and two, including a discussion of the projectâ€™s goals, feasibility, scope and timeframe, and any revisions that were required.

## Additionally, available to download is a demo video of our created software to better help you get an idea of what we actually did.
## Due to myself and my other team mates not owning the software we created as part of our contract, the source code cannot be shared.
